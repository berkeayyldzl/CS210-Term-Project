## Overview

This, is the term project for my CS210 - Introduction to Data Science Course. In this project, i wanted to see how my heart beat per minute (BPM) changes according to my driving.
To understand the hyphotesis and the results better, first i analysed the trip data, which i took directly from Opel's myOpel app in the csv format. Furthermore, the analysis of 
my health information, which is taken from apple health, parsed to only contain bpm,calories,steps taken, and weight data, as the total file was more than 550 mb's and consisted of more than 1.7 million lines of code.
