## Overview

This is the term project for my CS210 - Introduction to Data Science Course. In this project, I wanted to see how my heart rate (beats per minute, BPM) changes according to my driving. To understand the hypothesis and the results better, first, I analyzed the trip data, which I obtained directly from Opel's myOpel app in CSV format. Furthermore, the analysis of my health information, taken from Apple Health, was parsed to only contain BPM, calories, steps taken, and weight data, as the total file was more than 550 MB and consisted of more than 1.7 million lines of code.
